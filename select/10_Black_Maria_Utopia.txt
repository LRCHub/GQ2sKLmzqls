Black maria, you scare me so
I feel as though my heart stop dead
Youre a liar, this I know
I watch you go around my head

Oh, Im going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

Gay deceiver, my eyes they burned
My insides turned, my brain it rolled
Unbeliever, but now Ive learned
I took my turn, I come up cold
